## Unreleased
### Changed
- The notation for alternative interpretations has changed from apostrophe (')
  to backtick (`) so apostraphes may be used naturally.
- Expanded punctuation to support parenthesis in both ParmaitÃ« and Annatar
  including apostraphe, comma, colon, and full-stop. 
- Added OE and IE diphthongs in the mode for general use.
- Changed the default representation for the PH cluster in the mode for general
  use to retain a hint of the unusual orthography for formen by using the
  combined formen-parma tengwa as is attested.

## 1.2.6
### Fixed
- Addressed an error in the spelling of Y in the mode for general use.
