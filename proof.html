        <h1>Tengwar Proofs</h1>

        <p>
        The following sections cover automated test results and manual proofs
        for reviewing the tengwar transcriber’s behaviors.
        Please carefully consider each section and make sure that the necessary
        tests are present and passing for the corresponding code changes.
        </p>

        <h1>Tengwar to Tehtar Matching Tables</h1>

        <p>
        In Dan Smith style fonts, the tehtar are zero-width characters that
        draw diacritics on the glyph behind them.
        Since the tengwar typically vary in width, Dan Smith fonts provide at
        least four variations on each tehtar, so they can be drawn different
        distances behind the cursor.
        </p>

        <p>
        While in the theory of Dan Smith fonts it should be possible to use the
        same text for any of the Dan Smith fonts, in practice, ugly details
        emerge.
        The flowing script of the one ring, Tengwar Annatar, in particular,
        produces many pesky exceptions that the more regular fonts do not
        exhibit.
        The positions of the tehtar vary and, not every tehta can be rendered
        over every tengwa, forcing the transcriber to choose other variations
        of the tengwa or simply pass the tehta to a subsequent carrier.
        </p>

        <p>
        The following tables provide a means for manually confirming that
        drivers for each font produce an aesthetically appropriate solution for
        each tehta and tengwa combination, or are simply greyed out if the
        combination is not sensible.
        </p>
