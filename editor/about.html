        <h1>Tengwar Transcriber</h1>

        <p><em><strong>Usage:</strong></em>
        <a href="index.html">This</a> is a live transcriber from our Latin
        phonetic alphabet to the Elvish Tengwar alphabet.  Type a message in
        the bottom text area and it will be displayed in the equivalent Elvish
        letters in the area above.  Copy the link in the address bar and send
        your message to friends and colleagues.  Copy the Wiki text and paste
        the Tengwar Markup block into an article on a Wiki that
        <a href="#support-wiki-markup">supports</a> this Tengwar
        Transcriber.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Compatibility:</strong></em> The transcriber may not
        work in some browsers because I used fancy early-draft features of some
        other web browsers. I might go through the motions to make it work in
        legacy browsers some day, but this would be an expensive and
        unsatisfying project.</p>

        <p>However, there is a much older
        <a href="http://tengwar.art.pl/tengwar/ott/start.php?l=en">tengwar transcriber</a>
        that should suffice in the interim.</p>

        <a name="wiki-markup-support"></a>
        <p><em><strong>Wiki Markup Support:</strong></em> At present, no wikis
        support Tengwar transcription with this tool.  If you maintain a
        MediaWiki installation and would like to add support for this tool,
        I’ve published an open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/tengwarjs/blob/master/mediawiki/tengwar.php">MediaWiki extension</a>.
        Install that PHP script and incorporate the transcriber’s static assets
        in your page, which include <code>tengwar.min.js</code>, and the
        <code>css</code>, <code>ttf</code>, <code>eot</code>, <code>svg</code>,
        <code>woff</code> files for <code>tengwar-annatar</code> and
        <code>tengwar-parmaite</code> from
        <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/tengwarjs">TengwarJS</a>.</p>
        
        <p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong></em> The transcriber is suitable for
        rendering <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sindarin">Sindarin</a> in
        <a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_general.htm">General&nbsp;Use&nbsp</a>,
        more or the
        <a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_beleriand.htm">Mode&nbsp;of&nbsp;Beleriand</a>,
        and <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Quenay">Quenya</a> in the
        <a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_quenya.htm">Classical</a>
        mode.  The <a href="modes.html">Mode Selector</a> provides information,
        options, and instructions for comparing Tengwar modes, fonts, and the
        supported languages.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Technical details:</strong></em>
        The transcriber gives you the option of using either the italic of
        Johan Winge’s
        <a href="http://home.student.uu.se/jowi4905/fonts/annatar.html">Tengwar Annatar</a>
        or Måns Björkman’s book-hand
        <a href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/parmaite.htm">Tengwar Parmaitë</a>.
        Both fonts have been modified to include certain alternate characters
        in the untypable regions of a single font because of technical
        limitations of rendering fonts in web browsers.  Particularly, a font
        cannot paint outside its container, so a tehta rendered alone in a span
        would be invisible.

        <p><em>Tengwar Annatar’s</em> italic resembles the <em>Ring
        Inscription</em> from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, presumably in
        Sauron’s own cursive.</p>

        <p><em>Tengwar Parmaitë</em> is a script suitable for writing with a
        pen.</p>

        <p>The font uses an “encoding” established by
        <a href="http://www.acondia.com/fonts/tengwar/index.html">Dan Smith</a>
        wherein letters on an English qwerty keyboard are arranged to correspond
        with the Tengwar grid transposed on its side.
        Because there are not enough characters accessible on an the keyboard
        to represent all of the glyphs and alternate glyphs of the Tengwar
        alphabet, Johan’s Annatar provides some glyphs in an alternate font.</p>

        <p>Because of limitations in rendering text on the web and the
        peculiarities of Elvish fonts, it was not possible to alternate between
        the normal and alternate fonts in this application.  Instead, I’ve
        created a custom version of the font that incorporates the alternate
        glyphs I needed for this mode using code points that are not so
        accessible on the keyboard, particularly for doubled long-O and long-U
        diacritics, the paired curls forward and backward, and also some
        rotated U-hook tehtar that were less prone to overlap with the
        underlying tengwar.</p>

        <p>The particular limitation is that diacritics in Elvish have no width
        and are drawn before the cursor. Some of the diacritics I use are in
        the alternate font.  To put an alternate diacritic over the previous
        tengwa, consonant, glyph, you have to put it in a
        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag with the alternate font face, but as a
        result, the bounding box for the character has zero-width.  I could not
        find a way to render the text outside the bounding box of the tag.</p>

        <p>This transcriber does not require the character encoding to use code
        points that are accessible on a qwerty keyboard, so it might be
        worthwhile to create a new font that seizes a neglected pane of Unicode
        and uses ligatures and kerning instead of zero-width diacritics.  The
        difficulty is that every combination and cluster of diacritics would
        need to have a unique and customized code-point, anchoring diacritics
        precisely where they need to be or providing ligatures for difficult
        placements.</p>

        <p>If you take a look
        <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/tengwarjs">under the bonnet</a>,
        the transcriber is a CommonJS module, suitable for use both with a
        NodeJS package available in NPM as <code>tengwar</code> and usable as a
        browser script with the minified bundle.</p>

        <p>Further work might include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>More modes of transcription, particularly phonetic and
            orthographic English and Quenya.</li>
            <li>Tie-in with IPA dictionaries of various languages</li>
            <li>Tie-in with Elvish dictionary for special-cases</li>
            <li>Display intermediate encoding that shows the names of each
            tengwa and tehta in every cluster.</li>
            <li>Search the dictionary, encyclopedia, and map.</li>
        </ul>
